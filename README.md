# Liver-Tumor-Detection
Segmenting the liver and tumors from computed tomography (CT) scans is crucial for medical studies utilizing machine and deep learning techniques. In this study, an automated system is proposed that employs ResNet50 as a feature extractor to efficiently capture spatial and semantic information from CT images. The extracted features are subsequently classified using a Random Forest Classifier to distinguish between liver, tumor, and background regions. Experiments were conducted on the LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS17) Database) dataset, where the model achieved a training accuracy of 98.74% and a testing accuracy of 90.48% on 128 Ã— 128 pixel images. These results validate the effectiveness of combining deep feature extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers for medical image segmentation tasks. The performance of the system was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and the Confusion Matrix, highlighting its robustness and reliability for liver and tumor segmentation.
